# Getting over the website hump

A short web-based presentation I made for the Teen Tech Hackathon.

## How to run this

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (so you have NPM installed).
- Run `npm install` in the root directory of this folder.
- Run `npm run dev`.

Built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
